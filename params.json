Using MapReduce strategy we could split the work and then combine the results in a concurrent dictionary:\r\n\r\n![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kp8P4JNTZGs/Vf6rVGiuweI/AAAAAAAAFHk/uwvz_faeJjY/s640/examplemapreduce.png)\r\n\r\n*Example usage:*\r\n```C#\r\nReducer reducer = new Reducer();\r\ntry\r\n{\r\n    string readText = File.ReadAllText(args[0]);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Starting reduction\");\r\n    reducer.MapReduce(readText);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Reduction completed\");\r\n    File.WriteAllText(\"Results.txt\", reducer.SortedResults().ToString());\r\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Done!, processing {0:D} words\", reducer.Numwords);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Please review Results.txt\");\r\n\r\n}\r\ncatch (Exception ex)\r\n{\r\n    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);                \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Benchmark testing:**\r\n\r\n- This solution can count 500k workds in 400ms using 1 processor with 4 cores.\r\n- Download the version 1.0 from here. https://app.box.com/s/jfh684sgqtp0it856fvcv6186sssn3m3\r\n\r\n**Licence**\r\n-------\r\n\r\n    The MIT License (MIT)\r\n    \r\n    Copyright (c) 2015 Jordi Corbilla\r\n    \r\n    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\n    of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\n    in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\n    to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\n    copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\n    furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n    \r\n    The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\n    all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n    \r\n    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\n    IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\n    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
